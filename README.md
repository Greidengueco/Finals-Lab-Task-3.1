# Finals-Lab-Task-3.1 Using MYSQL CLAUSE

This portfolio shows basic SQL skills through MySQL queries. It focuses on managing an online course database by retrieving, organizing, and summarizing data using different SQL techniques on an existing dataset.

## Step by Step Process

- Task 1: Retrieve all courses where students_enrolled is less than the enrollment_limit.
  
- Task 2: Group courses by category and calculate the total number of students enrolled for each category.
  
- Task 3: Retrieve the courses that are fully enrolled (i.e., students_enrolled equals enrollment limit).
 
- Task 4: Calculate the total number of students enrolled across all courses.
  
- Task 5: Sort courses by students enrolled in ascending order.
